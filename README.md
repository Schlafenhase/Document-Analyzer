# Document Analyzer üìÑüîç

<p align=center><img src="Docs/readme-images/da-banner.png" width="fit-content"></p>

Document Analyzer is a three-layered app to process and analyze company documents for sensitive or specific strings of information. It features a **React** website, **ASP .NET Core** as a REST API and a mixture of databases with **Microsoft SQL Server**, **MongoDB** & **Azure Blob Storage**.

Main features:

* Classic gradient-inspired look
* Simple way to upload and check processed documents and their information
* Automatic document analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Support for **.txt**, **.docx** and **.pdf** files
* Basic Authentication (BA) sign-in system
* Integrated app architecture for easy deployment
* Responsive cross-platform compatibility

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites üëì

Software you need to install to run this project:

```
Website Client - React version 17 or higher
Services REST API - Visual Studio 2019
Database - MongoDB version 4.4 or higher, Microsoft SQL Server 2019 or higher
Object storage - Any external server that supports downloading/uploading files. We use Azure Blob Storage. 
```

### Installing üíª

#### Web üï∏

First, copy the repository on your local machine to get started. The **Web** folder contains all webpage data. Navigate to that directory using Terminal or the equivalent app in your operating system that supports NodeJS commands. Then, run the following:

```
npm i
```

This will install all required dependencies for the React web project, as denoted on the file *package.json*. Once that's done, you may now run the local development server using the following command in the same directory.

```
npm start
```

If the above command doesn't work, try installing the Yarn package manager and running *yarn run start*.

This will start the React development server associated with this project. You can access it at any browser, just type **localhost::3000** in the search bar. Be careful to not close the terminal window, as this will stop the server. You may also use NodeJS or React (Yarn) plugins in your IDE that allow you to run the previous terminal command. 

At this IP address you can check out a general view of the app, but for the full experience you'll need to run the API, which is supported on Microsoft Windows, macOS and GNU Linux with the help of .NET Core. Setup will be discussed in the subsection below.

If the Services API and databases are already up and running, open the file **constants.ts** and change the *baseURL* string to the public IP address where the API is hosted.

#### Services API & Databases ‚öô

It's possible to run the server on a computer connected to a local area network and use the website from other devices, but it's important that both database and API run on the same computer, as they communicate and exchange information. To connect from another device on a local network, simply replace the domain "localhost" with the IPv4 address of the server machine. On Windows, the IPv4 address is accessed by running the command *ipconfig* through cmd. On macOS you can go to System Preferences and select *Network* to display the machine's current IP Address.

To start, grab a copy of Microsoft SQL Server as well a MongoDB (We tried the Community edition and it worked well) and install it locally. Download Visual Studio (not Code) and add the **.NET Core** dependencies required to run these projects. Then open **DocumentAnalyzerAPI.sln** located in the **API/DocumentAnalyzerAPI** folder. Press the start button to run the API on your local network.

Navigate to the *NuGet Package Manager Console*, select the MVC subproject as *DocumentAnalyzerAPI.MVC* and run the following command:

```
update-database -Context ApplicationDbContext
```

Once it finishes, change the subproject to *DocumentAnalyzerAPI.I.D* and run:

```
update-database -Context EntitiesDbContext
```

This will create the necessary databases in SQL Server using the entities defined by .NET Core's Entity Framework. By default, it will try to connect to a local database instance. However, this will only work in Microsoft Windows platforms, because MS SQL Server only runs natively there. If required to run the API on a different operating system, modify the SQL Server connection string coded in *ConnectionStrings* attribute, located in the file **appsettings.json**, inside the folder *API/DocumentAnalyzerAPI/*.

Finally, the client web app should update with the server information. The MongoDB Database will be created automatically and will continue to operate by itself in a local instance, but the same **appsettings.json** file allows for a different instance assigned to a specific connection string in the attribute *MongoDatabaseSettings*. For file storage it's also important to set the corresponding tokens for connecting to an Azure Blobs server. These are found in conjunction with the SQL Server and MongoDB connection strings.

You may now change the *baseURL* string in the web app, as explained above. This will allow you to test the app's full functionality. 

Our tests were made on Windows, macOS and Linux computers running React 17.0.3, Visual Studio and SQL Server 2019 for the full stack. A CI pipeline was also implemented with GitHub Actions on this repository for build, test and code quality analysis purposes.
